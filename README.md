Real-Time Sign Language Interpreter

Overview

The Real-Time Sign Language Interpreter leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize and interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real time. It provides both visual and audio feedback, enhancing accessibility for communication.

Features

🎥 Hand Gesture Detection – Uses MediaPipe for real-time and accurate hand tracking.

🔠 Letter Recognition – Classifies static ASL letters using a trained model.

👐 Word Recognition – Identifies dynamic hand movements with a classification algorithm.

🔊 Audio Feedback – Converts recognized signs into speech using text-to-speech technology.

📊 Data Collection & Augmentation – Enables real-time dataset expansion for improved accuracy.

How It Works

Hand Detection – Tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe.

Letter Recognition – Processes hand landmarks to classify individual ASL letters.

Word Recognition – Analyzes motion sequences to identify signed words.

Audio Output – Converts recognized words into speech.

Data Collection – Allows users to add new gestures to enhance model performance.

Future Enhancements

✅ Full ASL Alphabet Support – Incorporate dynamic letters like ‘J’ and ‘Z’.
✅ Expanded Vocabulary – Recognize more words and phrases.
✅ Personalized Models – Enable user-specific training for better accuracy.
✅ Mobile App Integration – Develop a portable version for smartphones.
